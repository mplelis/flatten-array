# Flatten Arrays
# Author : Mihalis Plelis

This Flatten Array Application can flatten an array of nested arrays that contain objects of the same type.
Java generics have been used in order to be able to flatten arrays of any type of Object.
If the array contains objects of different types, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
